# B Y O F

BYOF (Bring Your Own Food) is an app that connects your favorite bars where you bring your own grub, with your favorite food truck, making every day the best day ever!

Check it out here: https://byof.herokuapp.com/


# Features

BYOF is designed to be an on-the go, food-and-drink finder which features truck-to-bar schedules, food safety ratings, and user reviews of their feasting experience. Users who register receive the added benefit of being able to save food trucks to their favorites list and to leave reviews about their food truck adventures.



# Food Truck Info
See all the important details for a particular truck in one place.  Each bar listed in the "Bar's I'm Visiting Today" table is a link to a local watering hole. Read the opinion of other food truck foodies and contribute your two cents.
